# supply-chain-data-analysis-dashboard
This project features a comprehensive end-to-end analytical dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel to evaluate the operational and financial health of a multi-category supply chain. By analyzing a dataset of 100 SKUs—spanning Skincare, Haircare, and Cosmetics—the dashboard provides high-level visibility into market performance.

The goal of this project is to answer critical business questions regarding profitability, delivery reliability, and customer demographics to optimize the end-to-end supply chain process.

# 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard tracks four primary metrics to monitor the health of the supply chain:

Total Revenue ($577,605): The gross income generated across all product lines.

Total Profit ($572,323): The net earnings after accounting for manufacturing and shipping costs.

Avg. Defect Rate (2.28%): A quality score used to monitor production excellence.

Avg. Lead Time (17.08 Days): The average duration from order placement to delivery.

# ❓ Business Questions Answered
The dashboard is structured to provide visual answers to the following 7 dimensions:

Revenue vs. Profit: Analyzes which product categories (e.g., Skincare) are driving the highest margins.

Transport Mode: Breaks down the distribution of shipping via Air, Rail, Road, and Sea.

Order Size: Identifies the most common order volumes to optimize inventory and packaging.

Customer Demographics: Segmenting buyers by gender (Male, Female, Non-binary, and Unknown) for targeted marketing.

Geography: Visualizing revenue distribution across key hubs like Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata.
